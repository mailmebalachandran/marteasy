                        <Text style={styles.answer}>
                            Every fruit and vegetable varies a little in size and weight. While you shop we show an estimated weight and price for everything priced by kilogram. At the time of delivery we weigh each item to determine final price. This could vary by 10% at maximum. Therefore if you have shopped for something that costs Rs. 100 per kg, and we delivery 1.5 kg of the product to you (eg cabbage, pineapple), you will still be charged a maximum of Rs. 110. In case the weight of the product is lesser than what you ordered, you will pay correspondingly less.

                            Every order placed has to undergo a system driven process as well as a manual process in order to make sure the order reaches our customers on time, every time. For this purpose, a slot is booked for every order that gets placed in our system and the order picking process happens seamlessly. In this entire process we incur labor as well as an opportunity cost on the booked slot. During the event of a cancellation the entire process has to be stopped and reset. This takes up considerable processing time to open the slot yet again for another customer to order.

As a benefit to our customers, if you are not available at the time of order delivery or you havenâ€™t checked the list at the time of delivery we provide a window of 24hrs to report missing items. This is applicable only for items that are invoiced.

We will take the returned product back with us and issue a credit note for the value of the return products which will be credited to your account on the Site. This can be used to pay your subsequent shopping bills.</Text>
